## an Eldritch Horror Companion app

A simple app providing various helpful features needed in a standard game of Eldritch Horror. I do not own the "Eldritch Horror" name nor any of the "Eldritch Horror"  resources referenced by this app and this is intended for personal use only.

Supported features are:
- Selection of random cards (spells, assets, unique assets, artifacts, conditions)
- Random cards within a certain sub-category (e.g. a random 'madness' condition)

Features TODO:
- Random Ancient One
- Random Character
- Configuration for expansions used for play runtime (currently a subset of the expansions are always loaded)
